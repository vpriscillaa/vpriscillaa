Gentrification is a process aiming to increase the economic value of given neighborhoods. It usually involves changing the character of the neighborhood almost in its entirety. Although it is true that it serves its purpose of increasing the economic value of the area, it also unfairly often displaces and drives people out of their homes. These people are often low income, poc families. Gentrification not only shifts the average costs of homes and makes what was previously affordable unaffordable, but it also shifts the racial/ethnic group composition of the given neighborhood or community.

This map shows the most gentrified areas in Los Angeles. It is statistically shown that lower and middle class people of color and immigrants are the ones suffering the most from the fact that luxury housing development continues to be approved by the LA City Council. As the map shows, Downtown is one of the top ten most gentrified cities in Los Angeles where low income African Americans, Latinos and Asians made up most of the population.

Due to the fact that gentrification often causes rent and house payments to be unaffordable, many people are forced to relocate and some unfortunately even end up living in homelessness. The picture above shows Koreatown, a city in Los Angeles, and the homelessness happening in its streets caused by an increase in gentrification.

Although gentrification heavily occurs in the Los Angeles area, it does not mean it is not happening in many other areas. Some states being strongly affected by gentrification are San Francisco, Chicago, Philadelphia, Washington, etc. The image above shows an activist protesting against the rising rent prices in his neighborhood in Chicago.
